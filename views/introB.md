**JianSu DC is the world's first hybrid cascade UHVDC project**, the core equipment is all localized, and the world's first research and development of "conventional DC + flexible DC" hybrid cascade UHVDC transmission technology, integrating UHVDC transmission large capacity, long distance, low loss, as well as flexible DC transmission control, strong system support capabilities, demonstration and leading significance. Not only that, the project has developed 20 new equipment such as controllable self-recovery energy dissipation device, large-capacity single-column commutator, amplitude and phase corrector for the first time, among which the controllable self-recovery energy dissipation device can quickly achieve millisecond-level energy balance and greatly improve the power receiving capacity of East China Power Grid. After the completion and operation of the project, the Yucheng converter station has also become the world's first converter station using conventional DC and flexible DC hybrid cascade wiring.

After JianSu UHVDCDC is put into operation, it will deliver more than 30 billion kilowatt-hours of clean electricity every year, which is equivalent to half a year's electricity consumption in Nanjing, and will promote the annual reduction of 14 million tons of coal for power generation, 25 million tons of carbon dioxide, 250,000 tons of sulfur dioxide and 220,000 tons of nitrogen oxides in East China, helping to improve the environmental quality of East China and promoting the green transformation of energy in Jiangsu.
