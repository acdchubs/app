Â± 800kV Baihetan-Jiangsu UHVDC project (JianSu DC) receives the Gusu converter station, which adopts the **world's first conventional DC and flexible DC hybrid cascade technology**, in which the flexible DC part is `VSC` composed of 3 low-ends. `VSC1` It is connected to the Zhangjiagang power supply zone in the north of Suzhou, which has more power sources and is relatively rich in electricity; `VSC2` and are connected to the Mudu and Yushan power supply zones `VSC3` in the south of Suzhou, respectively, with heavy load and relative power shortage.


##### What is power reciprocity operation mode

The JianSu UHVDC power reciprocity operation mode refers to the operation mode in which the power is absorbed from the `VSC1` AC system and `VSC3` the active power support is provided to the transmission `VSC2` and receiver when the conventional DC operation is maintained in normal mode.


##### How to switch to power reciprocity operation mode

JianSu UHVDC is a direct adjustment equipment of the National dispatch, and the National dispatch center needs to order the JianSu UHVDC to be adjusted to the power reciprocity power reciprocity. After receiving the dispatch instruction, the GuSu converter station operates according to the power and operation time.

After the power reciprocity operation mode is put into operation, the `VSC1` power reversal is automatically performed at a rate of 100MW per second, and after the minimum power of VSC1 unipolar mutual aid is reached 50MW, the magnitude and rate of mutual aid power are set by the operator (the current bipolar active activity change rate set by the operator of GuSu station is 30MW per minute).
